Given two nearly identical square grids of pixels, the player must determine which single pixel is not identical between grids.
The game is timed and players start with 60 seconds.
Correctly identifying the pixel advances a level where the grid increases in size by one row and column and 5 seconds are added to their clock.
A wrong selection results in loss of one second.
Score is level * seconds remaining.
